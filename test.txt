Copypasta is a chunk of text that has been repeatedly copied and pasted in social media and internet forum posts. The term is a portmanteau of copy and paste and is thought to have been coined in an Anon community forum on 4chan in 2006. The Urban Dictionary added the term that same year. 

Copypasta posts can be thought of as a type of spam that's intended to get a reaction. Specific examples of copypasta often become so well-known and recognized through repeated exposure that the text gains meme status.  Here’s one copypasta that gets a lot of use: “Imagine going to an online chat and spamming it with brainless text for no reason.”

Another famous example known as Navy SEAL copypasta contains a long, violently threatening and over-the-top rant purporting to be from a Marine who claims to know 300 ways to kill a person – and that’s just with his bare hands.  Still a third example, is a block of text that begins "To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand __________."  This last copypasta was made popular by fans of the animated television series Rick and Morty.

People often paste copypasta as a sarcastic response to a mildly objectionable post or comment. The entire script of The Bee Movie has also been co-opted as copypasta.
